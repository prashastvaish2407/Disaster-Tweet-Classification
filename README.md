# Disaster-Tweet-Classification
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on classifying tweets as disaster-related or not. Tweets often include words like "explosion", "riot", or "annihilation", which may refer to real disasters or be used metaphorically. Our goal was to accurately distinguish between the two using deep learning techniques.
